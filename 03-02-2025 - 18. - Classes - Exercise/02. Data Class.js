// Data Class

// Write a class Request that holds data about an HTTP request. It has the following properties:

// · method (String)
// · uri (String)
// · version (String)
// · message (String)
// · response (String)
// · fulfilled (Boolean)

// The first four properties (method, uri, version, message) are set through the constructor, in the listed order. 
// The response property is initialized to undefined and the fulfilled property is initially set to false.

// Constraints
// · The constructor of your class will receive valid parameters.
// · Submit the class definition as is, without wrapping it in any function.

// Input
// let myData = new Request('GET',
// 'http://google.com', 'HTTP/1.1', '')
// console.log(myData); 

// Output
// Request { method: 'GET', uri: 'http://google.com', version: 'HTTP/1.1', message: '', response: undefined, fulfilled: false }

// Hints
// Using ES6 syntax, a class can be defined similar to a function, using the class keyword:


// At this point, the class can already be instantiated, but it won’t hold anything useful, since it doesn’t have a constructor. 
// A constructor is a function that initializes the object’s context and attaches values to it. 
// It is defined with the keyword constructor inside the body of the class definition and it follows the syntax of regular JS functions - 
// it can take arguments and execute logic. Any variables we want to be attached to the instance must be prefixed with this identifier:
// The description mentions some of the properties need to be set via the constructor - this means the constructor must receive them as parameters. 
// We modify it to take four named parameters that we then assign to the local variables:
// Note the input parameters have the same names as the instance variables - this isn’t necessary, but it’s easier to read. 
// There will be no name collision because this identifier tells the interpreter to look for a variable in a different context, 
// so this.method is not the same as the method.
